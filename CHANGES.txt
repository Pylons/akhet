2.0b1 (unreleased)
----------------
- Revamp documentation to focus on Pyramid's 'alchemy' scaffold.

1.0.2 (2011-07-20)
------------------
- Adjust app skeleton to match URLGenerator.app fix in 1.0.1.

1.0.1 (2011-07-18)
------------------
- Fix bug in ``URLGenerator.app``: it was returning the wrong value and was
  documented wrong.

1.0 (2011-04-04)
----------------
- App skeleton:

  + Simplify home page and add a Mako site template that can be easily
    extended by the user. New documentation chapters.
  + New default layout and stylesheet by Marcin Lulek (Ergo^), designed to
    be extensible and a learning tool.
  + Separate industry-standard "reset" stylesheet for cross-browser
    consistency.
  + Add "flash message" demo to home page.
  + Add "requirements" file for easy installation of dependencies.

1.0b2 (2011-03-19)
------------------
- App skeleton:

  + Add Beaker cache configuration
  + Fix bug in urlgenerator: missing variable assignment

1.0b1 (2011-03-19)
------------------
- Rename distribution to Akhet and app template to akhet.
- Delete all code pertaining to the SQLAlchemy library, which is now in the
  "SQLAHelper" package.
- ``URLGenerator`` makes generating route URLs and other application URLs
  more convenient.
- App template:

  + Change ``handlers`` to a package and refactor for larger applications.
  + Change ``models`` to a package.
  + Create a ``lib`` package and move helpers.py to it as Pylons does.
  + Add commented examples of advanced usages in init and base handler.
  + The ``url`` template global is now a URLGenerator instance. You can still
    call it as before to generate a route URL but don't pass the ``request``
    arg any more. The URL generator is also available in views as
    ``self.request.url_generator``.
  + Create the SQLAlchemy engine ourself; SQLAHelper no longer does this.
  + Change "[app:{{project}}]" to "[app:myapp]" in INI files so that the name
    is well known and easier to type on the command line (e.g., for 'pshell').
  + Ask whether to configure SQLAlchemy.
  + Switch to ``pyramid_tm`` transaction manager from ``repoze.tm2``.

- 'akhet/tests/make_test_app.sh' is a quick-and-dirty script to create and run
  a test application.

Repository Akhet created
------------------------
Repository "Akhet" was cloned from "pyramid_sqla" at this point.
All tags "vVERSION" were renamed to "pyramid_sqla-VERSION". A new tag
"pyramid_sqla-dev" points to the last code change before the split.


pyramid_sqla-dev (never released; changeset c0c74051c201)
---------------------------------------------------------
- ``add_static_route`` is now a Pyramid config method if you call the new
  ``includeme`` function. This is used in the application template.
- Add ``pyramid_sqla`` as a dependency in the application template.
- Delete websetup.py. Console scripts are more flexible than "paster
  setup-app".
- Fix but that may have prevented create_db.py from finding the INI stanza.
- 100% test coverage contributed by Chris McDonough.
- Delete unneeded development code in static.py.
- Set Mako's 'strict_undefined' option in the application template.

pyramid_sqla-1.0rc1  (2010-01-26)
---------------------------------

- 'pyramid_sqla' application template supports commit veto feature in
  repoze.tm2 1.0b1.
- Add production.ini to application template.
- Delete stray files in application template that were accidentally included.

pyramid_sqla-v0.2  (2011-01-19)
-------------------------------

- Pyramid 1.0a10 spins off view handler support to 'pyramid_handlers' package.
- 'pyramid_sqla' application template depends on Pyramid>=1.0a10.


pyramid_sqla-0.1  (2011-01-12)
------------------------------

- Initial release.
- Warning: a change in Pyramid 1.0a10 broke applications created using the
  this version's application template. To run existing applications under Pyramid
  1.0a10 and later, add a 'pyramid_handlers' dependency to the ``requires``
  list in setup.py and reinstall the application.
