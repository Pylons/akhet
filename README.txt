pyramid_sqla
============

**pyramid_sqla** is a library for Pyramid applications using SQLAlchemy, and
an application template that configures the model and other things similar but
not identical to Pylons 1.

Version 0.1 is an initial proof-of-concept release; the API is subject to
change depending on user feedback. The goal is a 1.0 release before Pyramid
1.0.

See the 'docs' directory for documentation.
