Akhet is a Pylons-like application template for the Pyramid web framework,
along with a small library to make Pyramid a bit easier to use. It has
extensive documentation that covers the differences between Pylons and Pyramid
and can serve as a gentle introduction to the Pyramid manual.

Documentation is in the 'docs' directory.
