Introduction to Akhet 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Akhet was created as a bridge between Pylons 1 and Pyramid, for Pylons
developers who were trying to understand the new framework.  Now that Pyramid is a
year old, we can see what application developers are doing after trying both
Akhet and "raw" Pyramid side by side.  Pyramid itself is evolving, adding
features and moving away from Paste, and Akhet must evolve along with it. We
also see users persistently asking for "more tutorials" and raising new
usage questions.

The 'akhet' scaffold (=application template) was widely used and worked well,
but it was a significant burden to maintain.
