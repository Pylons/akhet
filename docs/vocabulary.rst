Pyramid Vocabulary
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a supplement to the Glossary_ in the Pyramid manual. It focuses on the
subset of terms critical for Akhet, and compares them to Pylons.


Router

    A Pyramid WSGI application, which is an instance of
    ``pyramid.router.Router``.  Equivalent to ``PylonsApp``.

View (View Callable)

    A function or method equivalent to a Pylons controller action. It takes a
    ``Request`` object representing a web request, and returns a ``Response``
    object.  (The return value may be different when using a renderer.)

View Class (Handler)

    A class containing view methods, so equivalent to a Pylons controller.
    If the view is a method rather than a function, the ``request`` argument is
    passed to the class constructor rather than to the method. The
    ``pyramid_handlers`` package offers one Pylons-like way to define and
    register view classes.

MVC

    The Model-View-Controller pattern used in programming. Pyramid is more of a
    MV (Model-View) framework than MVC. Many contemporary web developers have
    given up on MVC as not being well suited to the web.  MVC envisions a
    three-way split between business logic, user interface, and framework
    interface, but in practice the latter two are hard to separate. A two-way
    split is more useful: the *model* which is all code specific to your
    business and can be used on its own, and the *view* which is all code
    specific to the framework, user interface, and HTTP/HTML environment.
    (The "controller" then is the framework itself.)

URL Dispatch

    A routing mechanism similar to Routes. It chooses a view for each incoming
    URL based on a set of rules.

Traversal

    Pyramid's other routing mechanism, which looks up a view and a context by
    matching the URL to a node in a resource tree.  Most simple Akhet
    applications do not use traversal, and this manual does not cover how to
    use it.  Nevertheless, we'll briefly explain what it is.

    Traversal is especially suited to situations where URLs can be arbitrarily
    deep in ways that are unknown at application startup, such as a CMS system
    with an article at "/section/subsection/custom-sub-subsection/my-article".
    URL dispatch works only with URLs at a fixed depth, where specific
    variables correspond to known segments; e.g., "/articles/{id}".

    Traversal runs *after* all URL dispatch routes have been tried. It's
    possible in advanced usage to create a "hybrid" application where the left
    part of the URL corresponds to a route, and traversal is applied to the
    remainder of the URL.

Resource Tree, Root, Resource

    In traversal, a *resource tree* is a nested dict-like structure such as a
    ZODB object database or a group of nested dicts. The outermost container
    object is the *root*. Each value in the nested dicts is a *resource*.

    In URL dispatch, the *root* can be any object. Normally you don't specify
    it, and Pyramid provides a default root.

Context

    In traversal, the last resource traversed is the *context*. The context is
    available to the view as ``request.context``. The context acts as a second
    kind of model (separate from your "models" package), and it may also
    provide information for authorization.

    In URL dispatch, the context is normally the same as the root, an
    unimportant default object. However, you can override the context on a
    per-route basis to provide authorization information or data objects.

Request

    An object which contains all state data pertinent to the current web
    request and the application runtime. It's a subclass of ``WebOb.Request``.
    Its attributes subsume the functionality of several Pylons globals
    (request, response, session, tmpl_context or c, url), the match dict, query
    parameters, etc. 

Response

    An object which specifies what kind of response to return to the user:
    the HTTP status, HTTP headers, and body content. It's normally a subclass
    of ``WebOb.Response`` but you can substite any object with the appropriate
    ``status``, ``headerlist``, and ``app_iter`` attributes.
    A view must return a Response unless it's using a renderer.

Renderer

    A function that takes a view's return value as input, and returns a
    Response.  Normally the view returns a dict of data values, and the
    renderer invokes a template to produce the Response body. Some renderers
    instead serialize the dict into another format such as JSON.

Event, Subscriber

    A mechanism for running arbitrary code at specific points during request
    processing or during the application's lifetime. You register *subscriber*
    callbacks for specific events, and Pyramid will call those callbacks when
    those events happen. The callback's arguments allow access to pertinent
    state data.

Asset Spec

    A fully qualified Python module name or object name, such as the strings
    "myapp.handlers" or "myapp.handlers:MyHandler". Many Pyramid methods
    accept these as arguments in lieu of the actual object. The colon separates
    the last item to import (a package or module) from the first item to fetch
    via attribute access (a variable in the module).
    
    Certain methods require an asset spec pointing to a non-Python file or
    directory inside a Python package. In this case, the right side of the
    colon is the relative path inside the package, using "/" delimeters
    regardless of platform. For instance, "myapp:static/" or
    "myapp.lib:images/logo.png".

Settings

    A dict of application configuration settings. This combines:
    
    * "deployment settings" parsed from the INI file (or passed in by
      whatever top-level script launches the application).
    * "application settings", or site-wide constants, set in the main function.
    * "application globals": data structures, non-SQLAlchemy database
      connections, a cache object, or other things that are global to all
      requests. These are also normally set in the main function.

Registry

    An object that is global to the application and contains internal framework
    data such as which routes and views have been defined. Application writers
    generally ignore it except when they need a setting, which are in its
    ``.settings`` attribute.
