Cache
=====

For caching, you can configure Beaker caching the same way Pylons does, but this has not been currently documented. One userÂ’s recommendation. Perhaps make a cache object in the registry or settings?
this should go away
pyramid_beaker has a cache setup method that ive written
and we should endorse the @cache_region decorator i think, this is the way ben wants beaker to be used afaik
OK. Can you write up a description so I don't get it wrong?
i would just link this instead http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_beaker/dev/#beaker-cache-region-support
since it contains explanation how to configure it - and usage well - its covered in beaker docs - http://beaker.groovie.org/caching.html#cache-regions
i would just link those two sections instead
you can get caching up in 1 min with that
i even think it should be set up by akhet by default
athough chris seems allergic to beaker in general
I can put it into Akhet, but I need the exact code to put in. I'm not that familiar with caching, and if I read the links I might get a different interpretation than you intended.
ok
i can put it in
i think i added it to initial pyramid_sqla templates, before you started working on them
I do think Akhet should provide similar caching as Pylons, I just didn't know what to do.
Where would the cache object go? Some place under registry or registry.settiongs?
there is NO cache object ;-)
thats the fun
you dont need it
also there is cache manager
like pylons has
basicly when you use the decorator approach or region function - it checks beaker namespace for whatever regions are set up
in configuration phase
so in your app you can do
pyramid_beaker.set_cache_regions_from_settings(settings)
in main() when you configure your app
So app_globals.cache goes away?
and now @region_cache works eveywhere
yes
this is the "new best way" to use beaker i believe
What if you want to cache something directly rather than using the decorator?
i THINK you can just instantiate cache manager - and it should already read the data taht pyramid_beaker.set_cache_regions_from_settings(settings) - set up for it - but i would need to dig into the docs
to be 100% sure
or.. wait
give me a moment ill try to test it
i can see that most of beaker docs operate with decorator approach really
OK, so i did a test http://paste2.org/p/1303025
and it still works when i instantiated cache manager
i just dont think a lot of folks use cache manager - because basicly you STILL need to make a callable that you pass to it
tmpl_cache.get(key=2, createfunc=cache_me)
so why use this form when you can just decorate cache_me function in first place - its a lot more ellegant
OK, we'll just need to explain why it's missing and how to create it if you want it.

::

  
    @action(renderer='/default/index.jinja2', permission='__no_permission_required__')
    def index(self):
        from beaker.cache import CacheManager
        cache = CacheManager()
        tmpl_cache = cache.get_cache('lalala')
        print tmpl_cache.get(key=2, createfunc=cache_me)
        return {}

ok, ill have to ask ben what he really thinks about this approach, i wrote config method with his blessing, so i think it should be all good, but its best to ask him

Misc
====

file:///home/ergo/workspace/akhet/docs/_build/html/architecture.html#url-generation-methods - misses current_route_url - its important to have that one, otherwise url generation for paginate or grid will be big pain in the ass
