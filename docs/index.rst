**pyramid_sqla** is a library for Pyramid_ applications using SQLAlchemy_, and
an application template that brings some of Pylons 1's features to Pyramid.
The API is now stable; version 1.0rc1 is a release candidate for 1.0.

.. admonition:: Important note for version 0.1 users

   Pyramid 1.0a10 made an incompatible change for applications created with
   pyramid_sqla 0.1. To use these applications with Pyramid 1.0a10 or later,
   edit the applications' setup.py and add 'pyramid_handlers' to the 'requires'
   list, and reinstall the applications.

Current features in the library
-------------------------------

* A SQLAlchemy scoped session, a place to register database engines, and a
  declarative base. These all replace the ``meta`` module in Pylons 1
  applications, making it easier to structure module code freely without
  circular imports
* Initialization requires just one line in __init__.py per database, and no
  boilerplate code in model
* Session management Ã  la TurboGears. This commits all changes at the end of a 
  request, or rolls them back if an exception has occurred. You can still
  commit and roll back on demand, and even prevent other parts of the
  application from committing during the request.

Current features in the application template
--------------------------------------------

* The model, application settings, middleware, and logging are preconfigured
  for a Pylons 1-like SQLAlchemy application
* The static directory is served under "/" instead of "/static", overlaying 
  your dynamic URLs
* Routing using URL dispatch and view handlers, similar to Routes and
  controllers in Pylons 1
* Listen on localhost:5000 by default (localhost for security, 5000 per Pylons
  1 precedent)
* Templates ending in .html are passed to Mako (or to your desired templater)
* A helpers module and the ``h`` template global. (You can change template
  globals in the subscribers module.)
* A separate logger is configured for the application package, and is added to
  the handlers module
* Configures logging in .ini and handlers
* A script to initialize your database
* A production.ini (new in 1.0rc1)

pyramid_sqla has five dependencies: Pyramid_, SQLAlchemy_, repoze.tm2_, 
zope.sqlalchemy_, and transaction_. It's tested on Python 2.6/Linux but should
work on 2.5 and other platforms. A set of unit tests is included.
