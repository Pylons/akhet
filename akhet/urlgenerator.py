"""Convenience methods for generating URLs in templates.

I shadow various URL-generating functions in ``pyramid.url`` and attributes in
the request. My main use is in templates where my method names are shorter than
the originals and you don't have to pass a request argument. In Akhet, a
subscriber callback registers an instance of me as ``request.url_generator``,
and another callback aliases me to the ``url`` global in templates. These
callbacks are defined in *myapp/subscribers.py*.

The source code contains commented examples of "static_url" methods. We're not
sure what's best here so we're leaving them commented and you can define them in
a subclass however you wish. That's better than releasing a bad API which we'll
then have to change and break existing apps.
