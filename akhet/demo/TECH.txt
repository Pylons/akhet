How the Akhet demo was made
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1. Create an Akhet application "ZAkhet" using Akhet 1.0.2 and Pyramid 1.2:
   "pyramid1.2/bin/paster create -t akhet ZAkhet".
2. Copy ZAkhet/zakhet directory to akhet/demo.
3. Chdir to akhet/demo.
4. Replace 'handlers' directory with a class-based view in views.py, using the
   standard ``@view_config``.
5. Add requirements.txt.
6. Update subscriber.py to reflect new renderer globals and add an 'includeme'.
7. Update __init__.py to remove SQLAlchemy and pyramid_tm, keep Beaker sessions
   and '.html', use the subscribers readme, and scan the views.
8. Add __main__.py to launch the package from the command line.
