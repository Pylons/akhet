Bugs and todo
-------------

* Static view route inadvertently disables "traversal" mode, need a custom
  route predicate that returns false if the file doesn't exist
* One test fails due to ZopeTransactionExtension/SQLAlchemy bug. Still
  determining what's at fault here and how widespread it is. If you get
  exceptions on session methods you may have to disable the extension
  (see docs).
