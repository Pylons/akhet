Bugs


* None. :)

Todo


* Add a production.ini and test.ini.
* Add a database demo such as a wiki.
* Allow keyword args to supplement settings in ``add_engine()``.
* Add an appendix explaining the different ways to initialize the database
  and why we chose an "-m" script over a bin script, Paster plugin, or
  websetup.
* Add an article explaining the exact differences in the application 
  template compared to the standard Pyramid templates, and why it was
  made that way.
