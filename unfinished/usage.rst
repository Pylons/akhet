Pony
----

The Paste Pony middleware is active in the default application; see the links
in the home page. It adds a miniscule amount of overhead. To disable it, edit
*development.ini*, section "[pipeline:main]", and remove the "egg:Paste#pony"
line.

* It has a pony and a unicorn (using Paste Pony)
